the goal of this app is to provide a tangible and multi-touch interface for Ableton Live, in both studio and performance settings. this is about a year old now, and started as a side project which i had to leave on hold for a while. in the meantime, I've had the chance to use the circular ReacTable, an interface for which is planned.

the reason for the project re-surfacing and development furthered is that i feel the world deserves this. originally planned to code this in Processing, but now i'm thinking about openFrameworks or Cinder. this means the same functionality, with improved speed.

for now i'm just setting up the repository with bits and pieces of TUIO code in different languages and outlining development.

collaboration most welcome, especially someone who already knows a bit about the Live API in M4L.
